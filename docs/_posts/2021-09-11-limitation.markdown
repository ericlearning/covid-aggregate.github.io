(A hopefully easy-to-understand summary of the paper [Complexity of the Basic Reproduction Number](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6302597/) with interactive visualizations)

Basic Reproduction Number ($$R_0$$). With the recent pandemic, this word is thrown around a lot in news publications, journals, and other media sources. Often this number is referenced in varying context, and used informally to indicate very different aspects of the pandemic. However, $$R_0$$ is a biological reality with a value that only means a single concept.

It is/does not:
* Represent the severity of the symptoms
* Represent the speed of the infection
* Represent a change of something over time
* Interchangable with Effective Reproduction Number ($$R_t$$)
* Change with vaccination and other medical interventions
* Stay constant across time, demographic, location

It is instead the number of secondary cases from a single case assuming a completely susceptible population.
