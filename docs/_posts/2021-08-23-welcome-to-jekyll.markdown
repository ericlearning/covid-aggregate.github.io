Hello! Covid Aggregate is a blog that aggregates various researches on COVID-19, especially on data science aspects such as forecasts or projection models. The purpose of this blog is to aggregate countless research papers on these topics, distill them down to their main ideas, and explain them in a data science perspective with interactive visualizations.

## Blog Setup
This blog is hosted on [github pages](pages.github.com), and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the static website from markdown. Interactive plots are mainly created using [plotly](https://plotly.com/), an interactive plotting library for Python. It is then exported to html, and embedded into markdown.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
